Comment:
 Some of the files include different license information.
 However, according to an email from one of the core developers at the
 assimp-discussions mailinglist at sourceforge, this information is outdated
 and "all of Assimp is 3-clause BSD with the unfortunate exception of
 ./test/models-nonbsd."
 http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=27966437
 ./test/models-nonbsd/ has been excluded from the debian source package
